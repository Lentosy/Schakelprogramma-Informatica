In Oracle Database, database authentication is the process by which a user presents credentials to the database, which verifies the credentials and allows access to the database. Validating the identity establishes a trust relationship for further interactions. Authentication also enables accountability by making it possible to link access and actions to specific identities.Oracle Database provides many techniques to control access to data. This section summarizes some of these techniques.Oracle Label Security (OLS) enables you to assign data classification and control access using security labels. You can assign a label to either data or users.You can use a single SQL statement to create a named unified audit policy that specifies a set of audit options. These options can specify system privileges, actions, or roles to be audited inside the database.To perform auditing, you must be granted the appropriate system privileges.A data corruption occurs when a hardware, software, or network component causes corrupt data to be read or written. For example, a volume manager error causes bad disk read or writes. Data corruptions are rare but can have a catastrophic effect on a database, and therefore a business.A human error outage occurs when unintentional or malicious actions are committed that cause data in the database to become logically corrupt or unusable. The service level impact of a human error outage can vary significantly depending on the amount and critical nature of the affected data.Planned data changes occur when there are changes to the logical structure or physical organization of Oracle Database objects. The primary objective of these changes is to improve performance or manageability. Examples include table redefinition, adding table partitions, and creating or rebuilding indexes.Planned application changes may include changes to data, schemas, and programs. The primary objective of these changes is to improve performance, manageability, and functionality. An example is an application upgrade.Data warehouses and their architectures vary depending on the business requirements.In a simple data warehouse architecture, end users directly access data that was transported from several source systems to the data warehouse.The process of extracting data from source systems and bringing it into the warehouse is commonly called ETL: extraction, transformation, and loading. ETL refers to a broad process rather than three well-defined steps. Oracle Database has introduced many SQL operations for performing analytic operations. These operations include ranking, moving averages, cumulative sums, ratio-to-reports, and period-over-period comparisons.Oracle online analytical processing (OLAP) provides native multidimensional storage and rapid response times when analyzing data across multiple dimensions. OLAP enables analysts to quickly obtain answers to complex, iterative queries during interactive sessions.Distributed SQL synchronously accesses and updates data distributed among multiple databases. An Oracle distributed database system can be transparent to users, making it appear as a single Oracle database.Oracle GoldenGate is an asynchronous, log-based, real-time data replication product. It moves high volumes of transactional data in real time across heterogeneous database, hardware, and operating system environments with minimal impact.Oracle Database Advanced Queuing (AQ) supports all the standard features of message queuing systems.">Topics for Database Administrators and Developers</a></p>

It has a powerful data parsing engine that puts little limitation on the format of the data in the data file. Oracle Data Pump enables high-speed movement of data and metadata from one database to another.ADRCI is a command-line utility that enables you to investigate problems, view health check reports, and package and upload first-failure data to Oracle Support.Backup and recovery is the set of concepts, procedures, and strategies involved in protecting the database against data loss caused by media failure or users errors. In general, the purpose of a backup and recovery strategy is to protect the database against data loss and reconstruct lost data.You can use either Recovery Manager or user-managed techniques to back up, restore, and recover an Oracle databaseRMAN and Oracle Secure Backup are accessible both from the command line and from Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control). A whole database backup is a backup of every data file in the database, plus the control file. Whole database backups are the most common type of backup.The RMAN BACKUP command generates either image copies or backup sets.Oracle Database provides a group of features known as Oracle Flashback Technology that support viewing past states of data, and winding data back and forth in time, without needing to restore backups. Data file recovery repairs a lost or damaged current data file or control file. It can also recover changes lost when a tablespace went offline without the OFFLINE NORMAL option.The cloud-scale Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance, commonly known as Recovery Appliance, is an Engineered System that dramatically reduces data loss and backup overhead for all Oracle databases in the enterprise.A centralized Recovery Appliance performs most database backup and restore processing, making storage utilization, performance, and manageability of backups more efficient.A protected database is a client database that backs up data to a Recovery Appliance. In automatic memory management, Oracle Database manages the SGA and instance PGA memory completely automatically. This method is the simplest and is strongly recommended by Oracle.If automatic memory management is not enabled, then Oracle Database uses either automatic or manual PGA memory management.Memory management is either automatic or manual. Oracle Database Resource Manager (the Resource Manager) provides granular control of database resources allocated to user accounts, applications, and services. The Resource Manager acts primarily as a gatekeeper, slowing some jobs run slow so that others can run fast. Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) is a repository of historical performance data that includes cumulative statistics for the system, sessions, individual SQL statements, segments, and services. Using statistics captured in AWR (Automatic Workload Repository), ADDM automatically and proactively diagnoses database performance and determines how identified problems can be resolved. You can also run ADDM manually.Active Session History (ASH) samples active database sessions each second, writing the data to memory and persistent storage. ASH is an integral part of the database self-management framework and is useful for diagnosing performance problems.Oracle Database completely automates the SQL tuning process. ADDM identifies SQL statements consuming unusually high system resources and therefore causing performance problems. In addition, AWR automatically captures the top SQL statements in terms of CPU and shared memory consumption. The identification of high-load SQL statements happens automatically and requires no intervention.">Concepts for Database Administrators</a></p>

This section describes some commonly used development tools.Oracle developers must design, create, and tune database applications so that they achieve security and performance goals. SQLJ is an ANSI SQL-1999 standard for embedding SQL statements in Java source code. SQLJ provides a simpler alternative to the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API for client-side SQL data access from Java.A locale is a linguistic and cultural environment in which a system or program is running. NLS parameters determine locale-specific behavior on both the client and database.Oracle Database provides native support for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data, including querying and indexing.JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a language-independent, text-based data format that can represent objects, arrays, and scalar data. A variety of programming languages can parse and generate JSON data.Both JSON and XML are commonly used as data-interchange languages. Unlike relational data, both JSON data and XML data can be stored, indexed, and queried in the database without any schema that defines the data.JSON is widely stored in noSQL databases that lack relational database features. In contrast, Oracle Database supports JSON natively with features such as transactions, indexing, declarative querying, and views.">Concepts for Database Developers</a></p>
